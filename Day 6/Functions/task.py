# Functions will give us a way of referring to all those instructions at the same time.

# Indentation
# Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

# Tabs or Spaces?
# Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
# Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
# Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.
